//* Challenge2:
// On a booking website, check if the user's age is valid for booking:
// Age should be at least 18.
// Write a condition to check and display a message: "Eligible for booking" if the user is 18 or older. "Not eligible for booking" otherwise.

let age = 18;
let result = age >= 18 ? "Eligible for booking" : "Not eligible for booking";

console.log(result);
